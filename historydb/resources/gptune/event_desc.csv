shared_ld_transactions,Number of transactions for shared load accesses. Maximum transaction size in maxwell is 128 bytes, any warp accessing more that 128 bytes will cause multiple transactions for a shared load instruction. This also includes extra transactions caused by shared bank conflicts.
shared_st_transactions,Number of transactions for shared store accesses. Maximum transaction size in maxwell is 128 bytes, any warp accessing more that 128 bytes will cause multiple transactions for a shared store instruction. This also includes extra transactions caused by shared bank conflicts.

shared_ld_bank_conflict,Number of shared load bank conflict generated when the addresses for two or more shared memory load requests fall in the same memory bank.
shared_st_bank_conflict,Number of shared store bank conflict generated when the addresses for two or more shared memory store requests fall in the same memory bank.
